## LLM Interpretability Research

During my Graduate degree, I did research on finding the exact circuitry that GPT-3 uses to solve algebraic equations. Specifically, we wanted to show that GPT-3 was simply learning very simple attention patterns like the "Induction Head", and didn't have an internal representation of the task. 
We found strong evidence for this - as you provide GPT-3 with more of a hint on how to solve the problem, GPT-3's performance increases linearly, without sharp increase as one might expect.

## Superconductivity Research


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. We showed that it's easier to create the conditions for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials. 
Here are some of the materials I studied (drawn in Reciprocal Space).

In the following diagrams, there are spikes in the DOS, which can lead to instabilities in the material (including topological superconductivity).

In my thesis, I compute the DOS more generally using Perturbation Theory.



## Quantum Computing Research


In my undergrad at Cornell, I researched ways of using Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations. Here is a simulation of the Heat Equation that I created. The code is written in Qiskit, so you can run it on actual an Quantum Computer.
