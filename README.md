# My Work


Right now, I'm making a better way to teach people math and science. I also think about ML in my free time. Here are some of my past research interests. 



## Rotations and Superconductivity


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. Specifically, if a material is rotationally symmetric, the idea is that it might "trap" electrons and allow for the conditions of superconductivity to hold. We were unable to prove that this does not work, but it's a different story to prove that it does work...

Here are some of the materials we analyzed (drawn in Reciprocal Space),

Spikes in the Density of States (DOS) lead to instabilities in the material, which can lead to topological superconductivity. We computed the Energy Spectrum of the above materials, along with their DOS.

In order to accurately simulate the Energy Spectrum of highly-symmetric materials, one has to do a very involved calculation, which I do in my thesis. We were able to show that you can create instabilities in rotationally symmetric materials more easily than in arbitrary materials.



## Differential Equations and Quantum Computers



People have ways of solving PDEs on digital computers, and one idea is to translate those methods to be used on a Quantum Computer. Once you have this idea, the steps you take are pretty straightforward. Here are some of the simulations of the Heat and Advection Equations that I did in my undergraduate research, which I ran on my laptop (that's right, I simulated a quantum computer on my laptop - this summarizes the state of the art pretty well...)
