# My Work


Right now, I'm making a better way to teach people math and science. I also think about ML in my free time, and am most interested in methods of learning that go beyond gradient descent. I'm also interested in improving the Transformer architecture, and other architectures that are better suited for storing memories and reasoning. Here are some of my past research interests. 



## Rotations and Superconductivity


The goal of my Masters thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. Specifically, if a material is rotationally symmetric, the idea is that it might "trap" electrons and allow for the conditions of superconductivity to hold. We were unable to prove that this does not work (but it's a different story to prove that it does work...).

Here are the types of materials we analyzed (if you zoom in enough, the material will look like that).

Here are some of the Energies we found. When there's a very flat line, it means that the conditions for superconductivity might hold.

There's a very involved calculation you have to do to compute this accurately, and I do it in my thesis.

## Differential Equations and Quantum Computers


In my undergrad, I did research on using Quantum Computers to simulate Partial Differential Equations. 
People have ways of solving PDEs on digital computers, and the idea was just to translate those methods to be used on a Quantum Computer. Once you have this idea, the steps you take are pretty straightforward. Here are some of the simulations I did, which I ran on my laptop (that's right, I simulated a quantum computer on my laptop - this summarizes the state of the art pretty well...)
