The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. Specifically, if a material is rotationally symmetric, the idea is that it might "trap" electrons and allow for the conditions of superconductivity to hold. We showed that you can  more easily create the conditions needed for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials.

Here are some of the materials we analyzed (drawn in Reciprocal Space),

In the following plots of these materials, you can see that there are spikes in the DOS, which can lead to instabilities in the material (including topological superconductivity).

In my thesis, I compute the DOS for high-symmetry materials beyond the plots shown above.



## Quantum Computers and Differential Equations

In my undergrad at Cornell, I came up with ways to use Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations. Here are some of the simulations of the Heat and Advection Equations that I created. The code is written in Qiskit, so you can run it on actual an Quantum Computer. The inaccuracies come from the fact that the Advection Equation is not naturally represented on the Quantum Circuits that we use, and this is a largely unsolved problem in the literature.
