# My Work


Right now, I'm making a better way to teach people math and science. I also think about ML in my free time. Here are some of my past research interests. 



## Rotations and Superconductivity


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. Specifically, if a material is rotationally symmetric, the idea is that it might "trap" electrons and allow for the conditions of superconductivity to hold. We showed that you can create the conditions needed for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials more easily than in arbitrary materials.

Here are some of the materials we analyzed (drawn in Reciprocal Space),

</p>



In the following plots of these materials, you can see that there are spikes in the DOS, which can lead to instabilities in the material, and lead to topological superconductivity.

</p>



To calculate the plots for highly-symmetric materials you have to do a pretty involved calculation, which I do in my thesis.



## Differential Equations and Quantum Computers

In my undergraduate, I studied how to use Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) like the Heat Equation and Burger's Equation.
People can solve PDEs on digital computers, and I was using the same methods but translating them to be used on a Quantum Computer. Here are some of the simulations of the Heat and Advection Equations that I created. The code is written in Qiskit, so you can run it on actual an Quantum Computer.
